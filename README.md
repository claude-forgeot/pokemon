# Pokemon Battle

A Pokemon battle game built with Python and Pygame. Features all 151 Gen 1 Pokemon, move-based combat, XP/evolution system, team battles, and save/load.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Linux / Mac
./run.sh

# Windows
run.bat
```

The script creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and launches the game.

**Manual setup** (if the script doesn't work):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/Mac
# venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

## How to Play

1. **Team Battle** -- Select 6 Pokemon from the roster (92 available, locked ones shown in grey). Battle a random opponent team.
2. **Combat** -- Choose from 4 moves per Pokemon. Type effectiveness applies (fire > grass > water > fire). When a Pokemon faints, pick your next one.
3. **XP & Evolution** -- Win battles to earn XP. Level up to evolve your Pokemon (new stats, types, and sprite). Evolved forms get unlocked.
4. **Save/Load** -- Game saves automatically after each battle. Load previous saves from the menu.
5. **Pokedex** -- Track all Pokemon you have encountered.
6. **Unlock Legendaries** -- Mewtwo unlocks after 10 evolutions. Mew unlocks when the Pokedex is complete (151 entries).

## Combat Mechanics

- **Turn order**: Player attacks first, then opponent
- **Moves**: Each Pokemon has up to 4 moves with type, power, and accuracy
- **Damage formula** (with move): `((2 * level / 5 + 2) * power * attack / defense) / 50 + 2) * type_multiplier`
- **Type effectiveness**: Official Pokemon 18-type chart (fire > grass > water > fire, etc.)
- **Dual type defense**: Multipliers combine (fire vs grass/ice = 4.0x)
- **Immunity**: 0x multiplier = 0 damage ("No effect!")
- **AI**: Opponent picks a random move each turn
- **XP reward**: 20 + 2 * opponent_level per victory

## Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- Pygame-CE 2.5+
- PokeAPI (initial data population)
